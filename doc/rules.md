# Rules

All the rules Lintje follows are documented on this page. The heading name
matches the rule name, and can be used to [ignore specific rules per
commit](../README.md#ignoring-rules-per-commit).

_Lintje is primarily focussed on supporting the English language, other
languages may not be compatible with every rule currently. Please
[create an issue](https://github.com/tombruijn/lintje/issues) if you run into
any problems._

## What type of rules is Lintje configured for?

Lintje is written to promote communication between people within Git commits.
Write commit subjects and messages meant for other people reading these commits
during reviews and debug sessions 2+ months from now.

It checks for commits like "Fix bug" and instead prefers commits that explain
changes in more detail. Explain why the change was necessary, what alternatives
were considered and why this solution was chosen. This will provide much needed
context to future readers so they understand what kind of constraints the
commit was made under.

Inspiration for Lintje's rules:

  by Tom de Bruijn.

to fix them.

### Git for machines

Lintje does not actively promote machine parsing of commit subjects and
messages for the purposes of generating changelogs automatically.

The audiences of commits and changelogs are different. Commits are written for
people working on a project and changelogs are written for people using the
project. In my opinion a changelog entry not be based on a Git commit, but
instead be managed with another tool such as
[Changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets), which can also generate
changelogs automatically.

## SubjectLength

The commit's subject is considered too short or too long.

Short commit subjects like "WIP" and "Fix" don't explain the change well
enough. Don't be afraid to dive into a little bit more detail to explain the
change.

The commit's subject should be a maximum of 50 characters long. If the subject
is longer than 50 characters, reword the subject to fit in the maximum subject
length. Use the commit's message body to explain the change in greater detail.

```
# Good
Fix incorrect email validation

# Bad - too short
WIP
wip
Fix

# Bad - too long
One day I woke up and found the solution to this year old bug, the solution...
```

## SubjectMood

Write commit subjects in the imperative mood. The commit is not actively
"fixing" an issue, but it is a "fix" for an issue or it does "add" a feature.

Start the subject with something like "Fix ...", but not "Fixes ...", "Fixed
..." or "Fixing ...".

```
# Good
Fix ...
Test ...
Change ...

# Bad
Fixes ...
Fixed ...
Fixing ...
Tests ...
Tested ...
Testing ...
Changes ...
Changed ...
Changing ...
```

(_Where `...` would describe the change in more detail._)

## SubjectWhitespace

The commit's subject starts with a whitespace (space, tab, etc). Remove this
leading whitespace from the subject.

```
# Good
Fix incorrect email validation

# Bad
 Fix incorrect email validation
  Fix incorrect email validation
<TAB>Fix incorrect email validation
```

## SubjectCapitalization

The commit's subject doesn't start with a capital letter. Use a capital letter
to start the subject.

```
# Good
Fix incorrect email validation

# Bad
fix incorrect email validation
```

## SubjectPunctuation

The commit's subject starts or ends with punctuation. Subjects don't need to
end with punctuation.

It may also be that a subject starts with an emoji, subjects also don't need to
start with an emoji as a prefix of some kind.

```
# Good
Fix incorrect email validation

# Bad
Fix incorrect email validation.
Fix incorrect email validation!
Fix incorrect email validation?
.Fix incorrect email validation
!Fix incorrect email validation
?Fix incorrect email validation
üì∫ Fix my television
üëç All good
üêû Fix bug in email validation
```

Sometimes commits contain some tag for some machine to parse, like `[ci skip]`
or `[skip ci]` to avoid building the commit on the CI, and save some resources.
This rule will trigger if this tag is part of the commit's subject. Instead
move the tag to the body of the commit message. It's not relevant for the
subject, and the space can instead be used for describe the change in more
detail.

## SubjectTicketNumber

The commit's subject includes a reference to a ticket or issue. Move this to
the message body.

Invalid subject examples:

```
# Bad
Fix #123
I have fixed #123
I have fixed org/repo#123
I have fixed https://github.com/org/repo#123
JIRA-123
Fix JIRA-123 for good
```

## SubjectCliche

The commit's subject is considered to be a clich√©, it's overused and adds
little meaning. Expand the subject to be more descriptive.

```
# Bad
WIP
Fix bug
Fix test
Fix issue
Fix build
...
```

## MessageEmptyFirstLine

The line in the commit message body after the subject is not empty. If the line
after the subject is not empty, it is considered part of the subject.

This if the preferred format of a Git commit:

```
Subject line

First message line below an empty line.
```

## MessagePresence

The commit's message body is empty or too short. Add a message body to the
commit to elaborate on _why_ the change was necessary, what alternatives were
considered and why this particular implementation was chosen as a solution.

## MessageLineLength

The commit's message body has one or more lines that are too long. The maximum
line length in a message body is 72 characters. Split sentences and paragraph
across multiples lines.

Lines that include URLs that start with `http://` or `https://` are excluded
from this rule. Lines that are too long inside code blocks are also ignored,
because it's not always possible to reformat code to fit on a 72 character
line.

    # Good - max 72 characters per line
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam
    nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat,
    sed diam voluptua.

    # Good - the only too long line includes URL
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam.
    Source:
    https://url-to-page-that-is-very-long.org/but-still-valid-for-this-rule.html

    # Good - the only long line is in a code block
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam.

    ```
    Example code block with a very long line that will be considered valid!!!!
    ```

    ```md
    Example code block with a very long line that will be considered valid!!!!
    ```

    ``` md
    Example code block with a very long line that will be considered valid!!!!
    ```

    - Valid indented fenced code block inside a list
      ```
      Example code block with a very long line that will be considered valid!
      ```

    # Good - the only long line is in a code block
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam.

        Example code block with a very long line that will consider valid!!!!

    # Bad - lines are too long
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy aa
    tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.

## MergeCommit

The commit is detected as a merge commit, which is a commit merging one branch
into another. Prefer rebasing feature branches instead of merging base branches
back into them. These commits don't communicate anything meaningful other than
a person pulled in changes locally.

For example, when the base branch of a feature branch has new changes that need
to be included in that feature branch as well, rebase the feature branch on top
of the updated base branch.

```
# Checkout the base branch
git checkout main
# Fetch the latest changes
git pull origin main
# Checkout and rebase the feature branch on the base branch
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase --interactive main
```

Commits made when merging Pull and Merge requests will not fail on this rule,
these commits are ignored entirely, as they communicate when a Pull/Merge
request was accepted and merged into the base branch.

## NeedsRebase

The commit is detected as a fixup or squash commit. These commits communicate
the intent to squash them into other commits during the next rebase. These
commits should not be send in for review in Pull Requests, and they should not
be merged into main branches.

```
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase --interactive --autosquash main
```
