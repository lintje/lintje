# Rules

All the rules Lintje follows are documented on this page. The heading name
matches the rule name, and can be used to [ignore specific rules per
commit](../README.md#ignoring-rules-per-commit)

_Lintje is primarily focussed on supporting the English language, other
languages may not be compatible with every rule._

## MergeCommit

The commit is detected as a merge commit, which is a commit merging one branch
into another. Prefer rebasing feature branches instead of merging base branches
back into them. These commits don't communicate anything meaningful.

For example, when the base branch of your feature branch has new changes you
need to include in your feature branch as well, rebase the feature branch on
top of the updated base branch.

```
# Checkout the base branch
git checkout main
# Fetch the latest changes
git pull origin main
# Checkout and rebase your feature branch on the base branch
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase --interactive main
```

Commits from Pull and Merge requests will not fail on this rule, they are
ignored, as they communicate when a Pull/Merge request was accepted and merged
into the base branch.

## NeedsRebase

The commit is detected as a fixup or squash commit. These commits communicate
the intent to squash them into other commits during the next rebase. These
commits should not be send in for review in Pull Requests, and they should not
be merged into main branches.

```
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase --interactive --autosquash main
```

## SubjectLength

The commit's subject is considered too short or too long.

Short commit subjects like "WIP" and "Fix" don't explain the change well
enough. Don't be afraid to dive into a little bit more detail to explain the
change.

The commit's subject should be a maximum of 50 characters long. If the subject
is longer than 50 characters, reword the subject to fit in the maximum subject
length. Use the commit's message body to explain the change in greater detail.

```
# Good
Fix incorrect email validation

# Bad - too short
WIP
wip
Fix

# Bad - too long
One day I woke up and found the solution to this year old bug, the solution...
```

## SubjectMood

Write commit subjects in the imperative mood. The commit is not actively
"fixing" an issue, but it is a "fix" for an issue or it does "add" a feature.

Start your subject with something like "Fix ...", but not "Fixes ...", "Fixed
..." or "Fixing ...".

```
# Good
Fix ...
Test ...
Change ...

# Bad
Fixes ...
Fixed ...
Fixing ...
Tests ...
Tested ...
Testing ...
Changes ...
Changed ...
Changing ...
```

(_Where `...` describes the change in more detail._)

## SubjectWhitespace

The commit's subject starts with a whitespace (space, tab, etc). Remove this
leading whitespace from the subject.

```
# Good
Fix incorrect email validation

# Bad
 Fix incorrect email validation
  Fix incorrect email validation
<TAB>Fix incorrect email validation
```

## SubjectCapitalization

The commit's subject doesn't start with a capital letter. Use a capital letter
to start your subject.

```
# Good
Fix incorrect email validation

# Bad
fix incorrect email validation
```

## SubjectPunctuation

The commit's subject ends with punctuation. Subjects don't need to end with
punctuation.

```
# Good
Fix incorrect email validation

# Bad
Fix incorrect email validation.
Fix incorrect email validation!
Fix incorrect email validation?
```

## SubjectTicketNumber

The commit's subject includes a reference to a ticker or issue. Move this to
the message body.

Invalid subject examples:

```
# Bad
Fix #123
I have fixed #123
I have fixed org/repo#123
I have fixed https://github.com/org/repo#123
JIRA-123
Fix JIRA-123 for good
```

## SubjectCliche

The commit's subject is considered to be a clich√©, it's overused and adds
little meaning. Expand the subject to be more descriptive.

```
# Bad
WIP
Fix bug
Fix test
Fix issue
Fix build
...
```

## MessagePresence

The commit's message body is empty or too short. Add a message body to the
commit to elaborate on _why_ the change was necessary, what alternatives you
considered and why you chose this particular implementation as a solution.

## MessageLineLength

The commit's message body has one or more lines that are too long. The maximum
line length in a message body is 72 characters. Split sentences and paragraph
across multiples lines.

Lines that include URLs that start with `http://` or `https://` are excluded
from this rule. Lines that are too long inside code blocks are also ignored.

    # Good - max 72 characters per line
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam
    nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat,
    sed diam voluptua.

    # Good - the only too long line includes URL
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam.
    Source:
    https://url-to-page-that-is-very-long.org/but-still-valid-for-this-rule.html

    # Good - the only long line is in a code block
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam.

    ```
    Example code block with a very long line that will consider valid!!!!!!!!
    ```

    ```md
    Example code block with a very long line that will consider valid!!!!!!!!
    ```

    ``` md
    Example code block with a very long line that will consider valid!!!!!!!!
    ```

    - Valid indented fenced code block inside a list
      ```
      Example code block with a very long line that will consider valid!!!!!!
      ```

    # Good - the only long line is in a code block
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam.

        Example code block with a very long line that will consider valid!!!!

    # Bad - lines are too long
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod
    tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.
