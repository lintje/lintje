# Lintje changelog

## 0.1.1

- Add MessageEmptyFirstLine rule that checks if the line after the subject line
  is empty. If it's not empty that line is considered part of the commit's
  subject.
- Validate commits without a subject. Previously these commits would be ignored
  and Lintje would not validate them, missing very undescriptive commits.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.
