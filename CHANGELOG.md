# Lintje changelog

## 0.1.1

- Add MessageEmptyFirstLine rule that checks if the line after the subject line
  is empty. If it's not empty that line is considered part of the commit's
  subject.
- Validate commits without a subject. Previously these commits would be ignored
  and Lintje would not validate them, missing very undescriptive commits.
- Add Alpine Linux musl compatible build.
- Don't validate commit's which are squash commits from GitHub Pull Requests.
  It's not recommended to rewrite merge commits after they've been made, so
  they will be ignored.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.
